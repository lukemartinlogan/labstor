Client:
    IPCManager connects to server

Shared Memory:
    Regular
    Hugepage
    Kernel

LibFuse:
    User creates a custom struct fuse_operations
    LD_PRELOAD OFS with GenericFUSE LabMod
        fuse_main will register this process as a worker
        threads will be spawned which poll labstor request queues

    User calls write()
        - FUSE LabMod Connector

    How do we forward that to
    How do we get that into the runtime?
